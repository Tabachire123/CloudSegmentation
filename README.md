# CloudSegmentation
Projet deep learning 2022


This project is inspired by a Kaggle competition initiated
by the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology. The goal of
the competition is to identify cloud formations on satellite
images. It is proposed to identify 4 different classes of cloud
formations :
• Sugar
• Flower
• Fish
• Gravel
These cloud formations play a determining role on the cli-
mate and are difficult to understand and to implement in
climate models. By classifying these cloud formations, re-
searchers hope to better understand them and improve ex-
isting models.
